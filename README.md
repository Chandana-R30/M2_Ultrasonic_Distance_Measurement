# M2_Ultrasonic_Distance_Measurement_System

The project is designed to develop distance measurement system using HC-SR04(Ultrasonic Sensor) and interfaced with ATMega-328 microcontroller. The developed project is used to measure distance in centimeters with the help of HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, ATMEGA 328 microcontroller, LCD display via I2C bus. We know that human audible range is 20hz to 20khz. We can utilize these frequency range waves through ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.The advantages of this sensor when interfaced with AtMega-328 microntroller which is a control and sensing system, a pro per distance measurement can be made with new techniques.This distance measurement system can be widely used as range meters and as proximity detectors in industries
