The project is designed to develop distance measurement system using ultrasonic waves and interfaced with ATMega-328 microcontroller. We know that
human audible range is 20hz to 20khz. We can utilize these frequency range waves through ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.The
advantages of this sensor when interfaced with AtMega-328 microntroller which is a control and sensing system, a pro per distance measurement can be
made with new techniques.This distance measurement system can be widely used as range meters and as proximity detectors in
industries. The hardware part of ultrasonic sensor is interfaced with microcontroller ATMega-328. This method of measurement is efficient way to measure
small distances precisely. The distance of an obstacle from the sensor is measured through ultrasonic sensor. After knowing the speed
of sound the distance can be calculated
